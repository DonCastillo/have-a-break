# Have a Break

Browsing the Web can be very addicting specially if the user interface of the website supports infinite scrolling - where the user's feed keeps on generating and displaying new user contents. With this in mind, the user may not notice that he has spent browsing the Web longer than expected. Overconsumption of the Web can be detrimental to one's health and can impact the person's productivity. Imagine how many chores you can do if you cut your Web browsing time short.

Have a Break is a Chrome Extension that reminds you to take a break from Web browsing after a certain amount of time specified by the user. When you first open the extension, it would ask you how long you want to browse before you get reminded by the extension. By default, it is set to 20 minutes, which is the browsing time recommended to prevent eye strain. After you enter your desired time, you should press the START RECORDING button. The countdown timer starts when you start browsing the Web or when you go to a page whose URL starts with "http" or "https." The countdown is triggered by the following action of the user:

* Opening in a new tab
* Updating the tab (e.g. changing the tab's URL)
* Clicking anywhere within the webpage
* Scrolling anywhere within the webpage
  
The countdown timer should continue working and should sync no matter how many tabs or browsers windows you have opened. After the countdown timer expires, it would alert the user to take a break. Using this extension gurantees that you don't spend excessive time on the Web.

## Impovements:
If time permits, these are the improvements that I wish to apply to my extension:
* Being able to measure Web usage through scroll length
* The countdown timer still counts down even after it stops
* Improve the styling of the pop up
* Improve the way to prevent the user from accessing a webpage after the time elapsed.
